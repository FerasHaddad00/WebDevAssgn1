        <p>Hi, my name is Feras Haddad. I'm currently 24 years old. My parents are from Libya,
            but moved to Ireland before I was born. I'm from Dublin, and have lived there for
            18 years. However, I've moved around several times afterward living in various
            counties like Longford, Tipperary, Carlow, and now Waterford for college. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I'm currently studying computer science at SETU Waterford. This project is part of
             my website development course. I definitely love computers. Programming is probably
             one of my favourite activities to do. Going on coding challenge websites like
             LeetCode or Codewars excites me with their long list of challenging problems.
             I'd say it's definitely made me into a better programmer, with a better knack
             at creating algorithms. I'm happy with where I'm at. However, if it wasn't computer
             science, I would definitely pursue an arts related course. Most likely in music,
             and film. 
        </p> 

        <br>

        <p>I see myself as an arts person. The feeling of being inspired through any of these
            mediums is deeply fulfilling. I enjoy heading to art galleries, viewing paintings
            for hours, or heading to a music gig to listen to a wide variety of musicians
            I like. I enjoy participating in events such as this. It gives me something to
            look forward to, allows me to invite friends, and just gives me a good time. 
            I would say my first proper exposure to the arts was through secondary school.
            Among other subjects, I chose art and music, which ended up being my favourites.
            It gave me the chance to open up my potential, explore the basics and make 
            like-minded friends. 
        </p>
