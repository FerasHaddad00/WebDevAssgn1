        I'd say my first exploration through films comes after watching
        Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. As like any casual movie goer, after
        witnessing a mindbending, complicated movie like that pushed me to dive
        deeper into Nolan's filmography. Once I've watched all his films, I wanted
        to dig deeper through the rabbit hole, and discovered his influences in directors
        such as Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott.

        Looking through all these films gave me a profound experience. It allowed
        me to open up to more genres, more styles and an expanding view of cinema's
        century long history. Finding new and more lesser known movies became a lot more
        exciting. I opened up to watching more foreign language movies, and fell in love
        with directors such as:

          <h3>Orson Welles</h3>

      <p>
        Of course, this goes without saying, watching all these movies have gotten me 
        more appreciative of all genres, even trashy comedies or nonsensical
        romcoms. I like to watch anything.

        Probably, one of my favourite things to do is writing reviews for movies. I've
        only just discovered the website 'Letterboxd' recently, but when I have, I love
        how simple it is to log and track movies. Its large database of movies is simple
        to search through. Just type in a movie, and it will be there. I enjoy looking back
        through movies I've watched in the past. 
        <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Ferris_Wheel/films/" target="_blank">
          Here's a link to my films watched on Letterboxd
        </a>

        Reviews don't need to be complicated, just a simple sentence can suffice. Because of
        the laid backness, there are several witty reviews.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>Here's an example by user <strong>maria</strong> from Gladiator (2000):</p>
      <div class="review">
        <blockquote cite="https://letterboxd.com/usercillian/film/gladiator-2000/">
          THIS IS SPAR.... oh shit sorry, wrong movie
        </blockquote>

      <p>Here's a review I wrote from Patton (1970):</p>
      <div class="review">
        <blockquote cite="https://letterboxd.com/ferris_wheel/film/patton/">
          You cannot help but root for a man filled with so much determination and diligence
          even though he has so many faults and errors in his ways. Patton's purpose in life
          is to serve in the army. A purpose so many people seek, that it's rewarding seeing
          him succeed in anyway possible.
  
          It's an attack on himself when he sees soldiers lacking in discipline. If he sees
          a sign of cowardice, he takes it upon himself to get rid of it because of his
          perfectionism. There isn't even a rivalry between himself and Montgomery. It's more
          a test to show how capable and competent he can succeed.
  
          It's a brilliant character study, bringing about the question on how far determination
          can get us in life and what flaws it may carry.

          <div class="movie">
            <img src="images/Suzaku.jpg" alt="Suzaku Poster" width="200">
            <p>Another Japanese movie by Naomi Kawase. Inspired by her life
              living in the countryside, it explores the struggles of the 
              Tahara family. Left in the countryside during a depressed 
              economy. It explores the life of living through small Japanese
              villages, and the inhabitants making a living.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Blade Runner (1982)
          <br>
          <div class="movie">
            <img src="images/BladeRunner.jpg" alt="Blade Runner Poster" width="200">
            <p>A cult sci-fi noir creation garnering and inspiring many audiences
              leading to high praise and inspired movies. Blade Runner follows Deckard
              (Harrison Ford) as he investigates the escape of 5 advanced AI bodies called
              replicants. The story is rich with ideas, but the setting and atmosphere
              is unparallel to anything else. It's world created so brilliantly,
              all of movie history has never seen anything like it.
            </p>

            <p>Based on the book of the same name, it follows Greg (Thomas Mann), a teen
               who lives through his awkwardness and desire to be left neutral in high school.

               learning about a classmate, Rachel (Olivia Cooke), is going to die. Desipte its
               name, the movie is a coming of age comedy, making fun of the weird clumsiness of
               teenage life and discovering himself.
